        <p>I'd like to start off by using some mathematical puzzles about ants as a jumping-off point for discussing different 
programming approaches.</p>

<p>In the May 2013 issue of the Communications of the ACM [CACM, Vol. 56 No. 5, Page 104], <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/%7Epw/">Peter Winkler</a> 
poses three questions about the behavior of some idealized ants. The basic ant problem is described in this way in Su, Francis E., et al. <a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts">"Ants on a Stick"</a> Math Fun Facts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One hundred ants are dropped on a meter stick. Each ant is travelling either to the left or the right with constant speed 1 meter per minute. When two ants meet, they bounce off each other and reverse direction. When an ant reaches an end of the stick, it falls off.</p>

<p>At some point all the ants will have fallen off. The time at which this happens will depend on the initial configuration of the ants.</p>

<p>Question: over ALL possible initial configurations, what is the longest amount of time that you would need to wait to guarantee that the stick has no more ants? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter goes on to ask us to calculate the probability that the middle ant of 25 will fall off the stick in the direction it was originally facing. Then he takes the meter stick and bends it into a circle, places 12 ants on it (uniform random distribution) and asks for the probability that after 1 minute they are back to their original starting positions.</p>

<p>These questions can be answered without writing a single line of code, but where's the fun in that? Instead, let's consider creating an ant simulator.</p>

<p>Let's start as simply as possible. We'll use two arrays, one for position and one for direction. Once they've been initialized we can loop over them, updating each ant's position:</p>

<pre><code>for( int i=0; i &lt; N; i++ ) {
   antPosition[i] += timeStep * antVelocity[i];
}
</code></pre>

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
