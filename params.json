The basic ant problem is described in this way in Su, Francis E., et al. [\"Ants on a Stick\"](http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts) Math Fun Facts:\r\n\r\n> One hundred ants are dropped on a meter stick. Each ant is travelling either to the left or the right with constant speed 1 meter per minute. When two ants meet, they bounce off each other and reverse direction. When an ant reaches an end of the stick, it falls off.\r\n\r\n> At some point all the ants will have fallen off. The time at which this happens will depend on the initial configuration of the ants.\r\n\r\n> Question: over ALL possible initial configurations, what is the longest amount of time that you would need to wait to guarantee that the stick has no more ants? \r\n\r\nPeter goes on to ask us to calculate the probability that the middle ant of 25 will fall off the stick in the direction it was originally facing. Then he takes the meter stick and bends it into a circle, places 12 ants on it (uniform random distribution) and asks for the probability that after 1 minute they are back to their original starting positions.\r\n\r\nThese questions can be answered without writing a single line of code, but where's the fun in that? Instead, let's consider creating an ant simulator.\r\n\r\n### Purely Procedural\r\nLet's start as simply as possible. We'll use two arrays, one for position and one for direction. Once they've been initialized we can loop over them, updating each ant's position:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor( int i=0; i < N; i++ ) {\r\n   antPosition[i] += timeStep * antVelocity[i];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe finished program is [SimplestAnts.java](https://github.com/avklein/Ants/blob/master/SimplestAnts.java). When we run it with 6 ants we get output that looks like this (the full output file is [here](https://github.com/avklein/Ants/blob/master/SimplestAnts_random_output_1.txt)).\r\n```\r\nCreated 6 ants with speed +/- 1.0 cm./sec. on a 100 cm. stick\r\n\r\n     initial   initial\r\n Ant position  velocity\r\n  0    10.0    -1.0\r\n  1    13.0     1.0\r\n  2    18.0    -1.0\r\n  3    27.0    -1.0\r\n  4    43.0    -1.0\r\n  5    53.0     1.0\r\n\r\n    Time    Ant positions\r\n    0.0:    10.0  13.0  18.0  27.0  43.0  53.0\r\n    0.5:     9.5  13.5  17.5  26.5  42.5  53.5\r\n    1.0:     9.0  14.0  17.0  26.0  42.0  54.0\r\n    1.5:     8.5  14.5  16.5  25.5  41.5  54.5\r\n    2.0:     8.0  15.0  16.0  25.0  41.0  55.0\r\n    2.5:     7.5  15.5==15.5  24.5  40.5  55.5 <<<< ants 1 and 2 collide\r\n    3.0:     7.0  15.0  16.0  24.0  40.0  56.0\r\n    3.5:     6.5  14.5  16.5  23.5  39.5  56.5\r\n    4.0:     6.0  14.0  17.0  23.0  39.0  57.0\r\n    4.5:     5.5  13.5  17.5  22.5  38.5  57.5\r\n    5.0:     5.0  13.0  18.0  22.0  38.0  58.0\r\n    5.5:     4.5  12.5  18.5  21.5  37.5  58.5\r\n    6.0:     4.0  12.0  19.0  21.0  37.0  59.0\r\n    6.5:     3.5  11.5  19.5  20.5  36.5  59.5\r\n    7.0:     3.0  11.0  20.0==20.0  36.0  60.0 <<<< ants 2 and 3 collide\r\n    7.5:     2.5  10.5  19.5  20.5  35.5  60.5\r\n    8.0:     2.0  10.0  19.0  21.0  35.0  61.0\r\n    8.5:     1.5   9.5  18.5  21.5  34.5  61.5\r\n    9.0:     1.0   9.0  18.0  22.0  34.0  62.0\r\n    9.5:     0.5   8.5  17.5  22.5  33.5  62.5\r\n   10.0:    ----   8.0  17.0  23.0  33.0  63.0 <<<< ant 0 falls off\r\n   10.5:    ----   7.5  16.5  23.5  32.5  63.5      the left edge\r\n. . .\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n_Coming soon!_\r\n\r\n### Ants as Objects\r\n\r\n\r\n### When Ants Collide\r\n\r\n\r\n### Being Discrete\r\n\r\n\r\n### Strategic Ants\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ant Collections\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gold-plated Ants?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other People's Ants\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
